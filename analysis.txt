Data Flow / Algorithm / Steps / 
- File name
- read file -> string
- string -> scan -> list of tokens (type/value)
    - types of tokens: open brackets, close brackets, names (function, assignment, â€¦), numbers, strings/quotes, #t, #f, symbols
- list of tokens -> tree
    - Content: tokens
    - approach: new children if reach open bracket
    - check for enough brackets
- language semantic checks, type checks
    - number of arguments, string function need to be string
- Tree -> parsing/error handling and interpreting
- -> execution -> result
- result -> print
