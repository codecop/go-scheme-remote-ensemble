# go-scheme-remote-ensemble

Practice working with Go.

A fun project
to work on something algorithmic
for a longer period of time,
done in a Randori-styled Coding Dojo (aka Ensemble Programming),
several sessions of 1.5 hours.

## Requirements

Write a Scheme interpreter which

1. accepts a file name as first argument and
1. prints the result of evaluating the program to the console.

### Lisp (Scheme)

Scheme is a minimalist dialect of the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) family of programming languages.
Lisp (historically LISP, 1968) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a  distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
